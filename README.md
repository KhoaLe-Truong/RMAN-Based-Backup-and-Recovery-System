# RMAN-Based Backup and Recovery System for Oracle Database

A comprehensive set of scripts and guidelines for implementing robust backup and recovery solutions in Oracle Database environments using RMAN (Recovery Manager).

---

## Overview

This project provides practical RMAN scripts and best practices to help Oracle Database administrators automate and manage backup and recovery operations. The collection is designed to support various backup strategies (full, incremental, differential), automate scheduling, and streamline disaster recovery plans. Whether you are maintaining a production environment or setting up a test system, these resources help ensure your database’s data integrity and availability.

## Features

- **Full Database Backups**: Scripts to perform complete backups of the Oracle Database, including datafiles, control files, and archived redo logs.
- **Incremental and Differential Backups**: Support for level 0 (full) and level 1 (incremental/differential) backups to optimize storage and backup time.
- **Automated Backup Scheduling**: Example shell scripts and cron job configurations to enable fully automated daily, weekly, or monthly backups.
- **Disaster Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step guides for restoring and recovering databases in case of failure or data loss.
- **Backup Verification**: Scripts to validate and crosscheck backups, ensuring reliability and recoverability.
- **Retention and Maintenance**: Automated maintenance for obsolete backup removal and catalog crosschecking.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Instructions and scripts for database recovery to a specific point in time.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RMAN-Backup-and-Recovery-for-Oracle.git
cd RMAN-Backup-and-Recovery-for-Oracle
```

### 2. Review and Edit Scripts

- Open the scripts in the `scripts/` and `automation/` directories.
- Adjust database connection details, file paths, and backup locations as needed for your environment.

### 3. Set Up Automated Backups

- Use the shell scripts in `automation/` to schedule automated backups via cron or your preferred scheduler.
- Example cron job entry (daily backup at 2 AM):

  ```
  0 2 * * * /path/to/automation/rman_full_backup.sh > /path/to/logs/rman_backup_$(date +\%F).log 2>&1
  ```

### 4. Perform Restores and Recovery

- Refer to the `docs/` and `examples/` folders for instructions on restoring and recovering databases from RMAN backups.
- Customize RMAN restore scripts as necessary.

---

## Example Usage

- **Full database backup**  
  Run the following RMAN script to back up the entire database:

  ```bash
  rman target / @scripts/full_backup.rman
  ```

- **Incremental backup**  
  Run the incremental backup script:

  ```bash
  rman target / @scripts/incremental_backup.rman
  ```

- **Restore and recover database**  
  Use the provided restore scripts and follow the documentation for step-by-step recovery.

---

## Best Practices

- Regularly test your backup and recovery procedures in a non-production environment.
- Monitor backup logs and RMAN reports for errors or warnings.
- Retain backups according to your organization’s recovery requirements and compliance policies.
- Periodically validate backups using RMAN’s `RESTORE VALIDATE` and `BACKUP VALIDATE` commands.
- Automate backup cleanup to manage storage and keep only required recovery points.
